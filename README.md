# Slab synthesis and evaluation

![Slab Synthesis Example](imgs/example.png)

## Background
This project contains code to synthesize overlapping slabs (i.e., partial volumes) from images of the Medical Segmentation Decathlon [1] dataset.
The synthetic slabs can be used to train and evaluate an unsupervised registration model such as Voxelmorph [2].

The code is published to establish the baseline dataset referenced in the paper "Deformable Registration of Low-overlapping Medical Images." by Sabrowsky-Hirsch et al. 2022.


## Coming soon
Code and Documentation will be added soon.
